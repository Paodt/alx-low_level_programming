## Function pointer

This project is done during **C programming studies at ALX.** It aim is to understand Function pointer.

### Technologies

- C files was compiled using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- C files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Files

All the following files are written in C:

| **Filename**	| **Description** |
| --------------	| --------------- |
| function_pointers.h | Header files that contains all prototypes |
| 0-print_name.c	| function that prints a name|
| 1-array_iterator.c | function that executes a function given as 
a parameter on each element of an array |
| 2-int_index.c | function that searches for an integer |

**program that performs simple operations**
| **Files** | **Description** |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 3-calc.h | contain all the function prototypes and data 
structures used by the program |
| 3-op_functions.c | contains the function used in the program |
| 3-get_op_func.c | contain the function that selects the correct 
function to perform the operation asked by the user |
| 3-main.c | contain your main function only |
| 100-main_opcodes.c | program that prints the opcodes of its
